Passionate about video games, Iâ€™m dedicated to designing and developing great games.

I co-founded an indie game startup to pursue my passion for games after working at a renowned multinational company (Trend Micro) where I learned to collaborate with a strong, large development team. Currently, I am a Senior Unreal & Unity Developer at a VFX company (Moonshine) in Taiwan, helping our client to develop a virtual showroom which demonstrates realistic products to customers without having them to go to a physical store.

My top skills:
C#, C++, JavaScript
Experienced in mobile, VR, PC game development

I believe in and enjoy teamwork. Thus, I communicate proactively with those whom I work with (game designers, artists, and programmers) and strive to write codes that are easy-to-understand-and-use for them. I believe this is the foundation of great work.
